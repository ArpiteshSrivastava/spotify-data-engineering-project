# Spotify End-To-End Data Engineering Project

### Project Description:

In this project, we will build an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API on AWS. The pipeline will retrieve data from the Spotify API, transform it to desired format and load it into an AWS data storage service.
